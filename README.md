In this project, two neural network-based approaches are deployed to predict the out-put labels of a modified Fashion-MNIST data set. 
In more details, the convolutionalnetworks, pooling, and nonlinear functions (i.e. Softmax, Tanh) functions were de-ployed to predict the output labels. 
Furthermore, the predefined neural network layersin the Pytorch library were utilized to create a model using the given data sets underthe condition that the pretrained weighting values were False. 
Finally, the results ofboth approaches are demonstrated and evaluated. The approach with the maximumachieved accuracy was submitted on the Kaggle competition.
